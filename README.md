# tick_sightings

## About 
This project consists of a backend which processes a dataset of tick sightings and manipulates the data so that it can be filtered and viewed graphically by the user

## Choices
I chose to use Python and Flask for the backend as I had prior experience with them and knew they would be capable of achieving the desired goal. In order to display the graphical insights, I used HTML, CSS and chart.js, and hosted a webpage on render to make the endpoint accessible.
